Ansible config to install idp-3.4 on IDP clusters

Target site needs some setup before first install
-------------------------------------------------

(as root, on target)
# ./system-setup.sh


--------------------------------------------------

To install or upgrade the idp 

2) ./install.sh [ idp_eval | idp_prod ]

idp_eval = idpeval01
idp_prod = idp01, idp02, ...


Note.  Sometimes the install.yml has commented out disable/enable tasks.  
       This is to allow for a pre-disabled and idled host with no auto re-enable.

Note.  Scripts and etc may have commented out gateway code.  This gateway is obsolete.
